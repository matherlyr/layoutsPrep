    <h1>ðŸ¥³D3 LayoutsðŸ¥³</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What do all of these have in common?</h2>
    <p>The process in order to create these layouts in your code are very similar. First, you manipulate your data in order
       to make it useable for the layout you want to use. Then, you create your layout with the d3 algorithim that is specific
       to your layout. And finally, you edit your creation so that it is easier to read and understand. The following are the
       specifics for each layout Murray describes.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Pie Layout: 
            <ol>
              <li>Using d3.pie(), transform your array of data into an array that contains objects with the specific region 
                  of the pie chart that each object is supposed to use to represent the data from your original array.</li>
              <li>Define the demensions of your SVG and use d3.arc() to genrate the paths of the data. Then, create an SVG, 
                  set up the groups, and draw your paths.</li>
              <li>Insert text to indicate what numerical value each of your wedges in your pie chart represents. Also, you 
                  can adjust the inner radius for your chart to make it look like a donut.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
      <li>Stack Layout: 
            <ol>
                <li>Using d3.stack and .keys, initialize your stack function with your desired categories/keys. Then, call 
                    your stack funtion with your dataset.</li>
                <li>Create an SVG and set up your groups. Then, insert rectangles in the SVG to represent your dataset.</li>
                <li>Use .order() to rearrange your categories in a specific way. Also, you can do this with area graphs too.
                    When you bind the datum to your paths, you give it a class attribute of area and a data attribute of area.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
      <li>Force Layout: 
            <ol>
              <li>Define the force layout using the nodes and the edges in your dataset.</li>
              <li>Create edges in your SVG by the dataset.edges to append lines. Then, create your circles using the nodes.</li>
              <li>You can add a tooltip to each of the nodes. Also, you can make the nodes dragable so that users can rearrange
                  the nodes in any way they like.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
